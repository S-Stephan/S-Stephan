Hi, I'm Susan! In 2019 I was a stay-at-home-mom and military spouse who was looking to change careers after my children started school when I happened upon a news article about other military spouses who were learning to code and finding remote, portable careers as developers. I thought to myself, if they can do it, maybe I can too, so I started with a free online JavaScript course and quickly became immersed in the world of building software.

Since then, I've done more self-learning, completed a full-stack coding bootcamp, and have spent the past 2+ years as a backend developer for a music copyright CRM application. I've also found so many parallels between coding and my past music and library background! I approach a new problem in much the same way I would a new piece of classical music and have found that the way we classify books just screams database. I feel at home in Python because of its readability, but am always adaptable and open to expanding my skillset as I know the world of technology is constantly evolving.
